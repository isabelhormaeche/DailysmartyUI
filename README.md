## React/Redux/Router Starter Project

# DailySmarty Front-End Application

We are going to build the **DailySmarty** front-end application. The main idea is to connect this app to an API to fetch data. 


The application will have two screens with different functionalities:

## First Screen
- Contains a search field and a query.

## Second Screen
- Accessed via React Router after performing a search.
- Hovering over certain elements will show links.
- Clicking on these links redirects to useful articles.

## Learning Objectives
During the development, we will learn to:
- Fetch data from an API.
- Implement routing with React Router.
- Divide the application into multiple reusable components.
- Use Redux and middleware like Redux Promise or Redux Thunk.

This project will help you improve your skills in **React**, **routing**, and **state management with Redux**.

***NOTE:** Instead of the DailySmarty API that was not available at that moment, I used **The Star Wars API** from https://swapi.dev/api/people/*.
